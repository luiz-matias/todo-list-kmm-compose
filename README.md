## Design Inspiration

The UI and UX of the application is inspired by [Liva Veidemane](https://www.behance.net/livaveidemane)'s project called [_Lifetrack To-do App Design_](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129445451/Lifetrack-To-do-App-Design-UIUX)

## Project Features

The application will have the following features (simplified stories, without details or corner cases included):
___
### 1. User Authentication

#### 1.1. User Login
As a user, I want to be able to login into the application, so I can manage all my tasks with security.

#### 1.2. User Registration
As a user, I want to be able to register my account into the application, so I can have access trough my tasks.

#### 1.3. Password Recovery
As a user, I want to be able to recover my password in case if I missed it, so I can recover my access trough my tasks.
___
### 2. Task Management

#### 2.1. Task Registration
As a user, I want to register a task, so I can organize all the tasks that I need to do.

#### 2.2. Task Editing
As a user, I want to edit a task, so I can adjust all my tasks without the need of duplicating them.

#### 2.3. Task Deletion
As a user, I want to delete a task, so I can remove tasks that I no longer need to do.
___
### 3. Task Listing

#### 3.1. List of Pending Tasks
As a user, I want to see all my pending tasks, so I can organize myself to make all the tasks.

#### 3.2. List of Done Tasks
As a user, I want to see all my done tasks, so I can see my progress and keep motivated to do other tasks.
___

## Main Tools Used

* **[Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/)**: Used as a solution to share business logic between iOS and Android mobile platforms. It will allow me to avoid duplicating business logic code into two platforms, thus allowing me to only take care of view and presenter's based code.
